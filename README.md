# homework_responsive_portfolio

## Description 

Create a responsive portfolio using only HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. In this instance I also created some graphics using Adobe Photoshop
and Illustrator.

Set content using HTML and built layout using Bootstrap as well as CSS properties to make the website properly responsive. 

Had difficulties with create a sticky footer; however was able to figure it out with the support of my instructor and classmates. 

Had extreme difficulties with simply aligning the cover image content in the center (vertically and horizontally). However, after
a solid day finally figured it out. 

Opted to try and create a responsive portfolio from scratch following the instructions but create my own portfolio instead of copying
the theme of the layout supplied.
